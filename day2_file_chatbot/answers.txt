1. That's a great question!

Globally, the standard work week is often considered to be **40 hours** (8 hours a day, 5 days a week).

However, in many corporate environments, employees often work more than that. Depending on the industry, role, and company culture, it's not uncommon for corporate employees to work:

*   **45-50 hours or more per week**
*   **Longer hours during peak periods, project deadlines, or for senior roles.**

So, while 40 hours is the baseline, the reality for many corporate employees is often a bit longer.

2. That's a great question! Metal bottles offer several significant benefits over plastic ones:

1.  **Durability:** Metal bottles (like stainless steel or aluminum) are much more robust and less prone to breaking or cracking if dropped, meaning they last longer.
2.  **Healthier Option:** Plastic bottles, especially when scratched or exposed to heat, can leach chemicals like BPA (even "BPA-free" plastics can leach other chemicals). Metal bottles are generally inert and don't leach chemicals into your drink.
3.  **Better for the Environment:** Choosing a reusable metal bottle significantly reduces your reliance on single-use plastic bottles, which helps cut down on plastic waste polluting our planet.
4.  **Temperature Retention:** Many metal bottles are insulated (double-walled), keeping drinks cold for hours or hot for an extended period, which plastic bottles typically can't do.
5.  **No Odor or Taste Retention:** Metal doesn't absorb flavors or odors, so your water will always taste fresh, and you can switch between different beverages without lingering tastes.
6.  **Easier to Clean:** They're often easier to clean thoroughly and are less likely to harbor bacteria in scratches compared to plastic.

In short, they're better for your health, your wallet (in the long run), and the environment!
